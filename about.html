                        <p class="lead">A 26-year-old landscape artist living in Northamptonshire, creating oil paintings that capture the awe and grandeur of our cosmos.</p>

                        <p>Samantha Ellis is a landscape artist who gained a Bachelor of Arts in Painting and Drawing along with a Masters in Fine Art from the University of Northampton. Her work primarily focuses on the Skies and Stars of our universe with the use of oil paints. Samantha's paintings are a collection of weather data, star charts and a unique collection of information to capture the awe and grandeur that is our cosmos.</p>

                        <p>Each brushstroke becomes a conversation between earth and cosmos, history and hope.</p>

                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <div class="statement-content">
                    <p>"Around turning 22 I began to take notice of the world around me and the problems we as human beings have created and continue to carry on throughout our day to day lives. Being a woman I could no longer sit within the injustice around me and say nothing expecting it to get better. Being a white woman my privilege pushes me to speak and act. Painting is the only way I have ever known to respond when experiencing or witnessing the atrocities that are sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia and many, many more.</p>

                    <p>During my Master's Degree I began looking into existentialism and ideals behind the feelings of displacement of one's own life. This linking with the want to incorporate activism within my art, led me to paint the cosmos and its skies from specific dates and moments in history that have been host to some of the most shocking, horrifying and unbelievable points in time. On the ground some of the most memorable, vile and heart breaking actions were taking place, but look up and the sky stays as stable and as beautiful as ever.</p>

                    <p>At 22, I began to see the world not just for its beauty, but also for its fractures – the injustices, inequalities, and the weight of human-made crises. As a woman, I could no longer remain silent in the face of sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and the systemic injustices surrounding us. As a white woman, I understood the responsibility that privilege carries – to speak, to act, and to create work that challenges and inspires change.</p>

                    <p>During my Master's degree, I delved into themes of existentialism and displacement, weaving them into my artistic voice. My paintings began to reflect not only the grandeur of the cosmos but also its quiet, unchanging presence over humanity's defining moments – both beautiful and heartbreaking. Beneath those same skies, some of the most unforgettable and devastating events in history unfolded, yet above, the stars remained constant, reminding us of our smallness and our capacity for courage.</p>

                    <p>Climate change further shaped my artistic journey. Confronted daily with the fragility of our planet and humanity's role in its decline, I began using my art as both a lament and a call to action. Painting became not only a response but a promise – to bear witness, to spark dialogue, and to make a difference through beauty and truth.</p>

                    <p>I found it impossible to look at something so incredible every day of my life and continue to exist acting as if it never affected me. Everyone else seemed to choose to ignore the awe and amazement that was our atmosphere whilst I could think of little else. In the end it always seemed to come down to having spent my life shouting and getting nowhere, now I plan to spend the rest of it painting and making a difference."</p>
